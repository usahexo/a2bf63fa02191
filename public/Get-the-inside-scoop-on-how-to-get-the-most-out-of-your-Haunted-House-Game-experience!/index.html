Whether this is your first haunted house experience or you’re a seasoned pro, these tips will help you make the most of your time and scare the pants off of yourself!</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Arrive Early - Haunted Houses can get VERY busy on Halloween night. Get there early to avoid the long lines and ensure that you get to go through all the rooms!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Plan Your Route - Not all Haunted Houses are created equal. Some have long, winding hallways while others are just a few small rooms. Plan your route ahead of time to make sure you see everything the house has to offer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bring a Friend - Going through a Haunted House is always more fun when you have someone to scream with you! Plus, if you get too scared, they can hold onto you for moral support.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wear Appropriate Clothing - This one is especially important if you’re going to be visiting a Haunted House in cold weather. Make sure to wear appropriate layers so you don’t end up getting too cold or too hot while inside.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use Hand Sanitizer - Chances are, you’re going to be touching a lot of grimy things while inside a Haunted House. Make sure to keep hand sanitizer on hand to reduce your risk of getting sick.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay Alert - One of the best ways to get scared in a Haunted House is by not knowing what’s going to happen next. Stay alert and watch out for unexpected scares!</p>
