            <h1 id="Woman-Wins-5-Million-Jackpot-at-Atlantic-City-Casino"><a href="#Woman-Wins-5-Million-Jackpot-at-Atlantic-City-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Woman Wins $5 Million Jackpot at Atlantic City Casino"></a>Woman Wins $5 Million Jackpot at Atlantic City Casino</h1><p>A woman visiting Atlantic City won a $5 million jackpot at the Borgata Casino on Wednesday. The woman, who has not been identified, was playing the slots when she hit the jackpot.</p>
<p>“I screamed, I jumped up and down,” she said. “I just couldn’t believe it.”</p>
<p> It is not yet known how the woman plans to spend her winnings, but she said that she was “absolutely thrilled” with her victory.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a series of big wins at Atlantic City casinos this year. In January, a man won $4.9 million at Harrah’s Resort Atlantic City. In February, a woman won $1.8 million at Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino.</p>
<p>Casinos in Atlantic City have been facing tough competition from casinos in other states in recent years, but these large payouts are helping to keep business strong.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-Blackjack-Like-a-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Play-Blackjack-Like-a-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Blackjack Like a Pro"></a>How to Play Blackjack Like a Pro</h1><p>Whether you’re a casino regular or just looking to up your game, learning how to play blackjack like a pro is essential. Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games for a reason – with some basic strategy, you can give yourself a good chance of winning even against the house.</p>
<h1 id="The-Basics"><a href="#The-Basics" class="headerlink" title="The Basics"></a>The Basics</h1><p>Before you start playing, it’s important to understand the basics of blackjack. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over. You can either take cards until you reach 21 (called “hitting”), or stand with the cards you’ve been dealt (called “standing”). If your total goes over 21, you “bust” and lose automatically.</p>
<p>The dealer also has to hit if their total is under 17, and stand on 17 or more. In addition, the dealer always wins any ties (i.e. if both players have the same total), so it’s important not to go bust!</p>
<h1 id="Basic-Strategy"><a href="#Basic-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Basic Strategy"></a>Basic Strategy</h1><p>Now that you know the basics, it’s time to learn some basic strategy. This involves making mathematically sound decisions based on the odds of each possible move – for example, whether it’s better to hit or stand when you have certain cards in your hand. You can find a range of basic strategy charts online (just search for “blackjack strategy chart”), which will tell you what to do in every situation. It takes a bit of practice to get used to using them correctly, but once you have they can give you a real edge over the casino.</p>
<h1 id="Advanced-Strategy"><a href="#Advanced-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Strategy"></a>Advanced Strategy</h1><p>In addition to basic strategy, there are also a few advanced techniques that can help improve your chances of winning at blackjack. For example, one popular strategy is called card counting – this involves keeping track of which cards have been played so far, and adjusting your betting accordingly. This isn’t as difficult as it sounds, and there are plenty of online tutorials that can teach you how to do it properly.</p>
<h1 id="Tips-for-Winning-at-Blackjack"><a href="#Tips-for-Winning-at-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Winning at Blackjack"></a>Tips for Winning at Blackjack</h1><p>Finally, here are a few general tips for winning at blackjack: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stay within your budget – like all casino games, blackjack can be addictive if you’re not careful, so set yourself a limit and stick to it! </p>
</li>
<li><p>Practice makes perfect – don’t be afraid to try out different strategies until you find one that works best for you. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Know when to walk away – even if you’re doing well, it’s always important to know when to quit while you’re ahead!</p>
</li>
</ul>

More than 30 people were arrested and over $1 million in cash and assets were seized.</p>
<p>The investigation, which lasted more than a year, targeted an organized crime ring that ran a high-stakes illegal gambling operation out of several locations in Atlantic City. The ringleaders of the operation allegedly took in millions of dollars each year from gamblers.</p>
<p>“Organized crime’s greed knows no bounds,” said Attorney General Christopher Porrino. “This multimillion-dollar illegal gambling enterprise was funded by criminal activity such as loan-sharking and money laundering, and it preyed on vulnerable people who thought they could beat the odds.”</p>
<p>The seized assets will be used to fund future law enforcement operations.</p>

<h1 id="Trump-Taj-Mahal-to-Close-After-Labor-Day"><a href="#Trump-Taj-Mahal-to-Close-After-Labor-Day" class="headerlink" title="Trump Taj Mahal to Close After Labor Day"></a>Trump Taj Mahal to Close After Labor Day</h1><p>Atlantic City, NJ - Trump Taj Mahal will close its doors after Labor Day following years of financial struggles. The casino, which opened 26 years ago, is owned by billionaire Carl Icahn who has been attempting to sell it for months.</p>
<p>Icahn cited the recent increase in the state’s minimum wage as the final straw that led to the closure. The owner said that the casino will lose $100 million this year and he can no longer afford to keep it open.</p>
<p>The news comes as a major blow to Atlantic City which has been struggling for years to keep its casinos open. Trump Taj Mahal is one of the city’s largest employers with around 3,000 workers.</p>
<p> employees were given notice of the closure on Thursday and they will be able to apply for jobs at other casinos in Atlantic City.</p>
