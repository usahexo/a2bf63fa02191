            <h1 id="Arsenal-show-Roulette-prowess-in-win-over-Watford"><a href="#Arsenal-show-Roulette-prowess-in-win-over-Watford" class="headerlink" title="Arsenal show Roulette prowess in win over Watford"></a>Arsenal show Roulette prowess in win over Watford</h1><p>Arsenal started the game strongly and took the lead in the 7th minute when Lacazette ran onto a through ball from Ramsey and finished coolly. Arsenal continued to dominate proceedings but couldn’t find a way to extend their lead and Watford started to come into the game more as the first half went on. Watford almost equalized in stoppage time when Cleverley played in Richarlison, but his shot cannoned off the post.</p>
<p>The second half was a more even affair, with both sides having chances to score, but it was Arsenal who managed to find the net again, this time through Mkhitaryan who finished well after being played in by Ozil. Watford pulled one back late on through Pereyra, but Arsenal held on for all three points.</p>
<p>Here are three talking points from Arsenal’s win over Watford:</p>
<p>#1 The importance of Lacazette’s early goal<br>Arsenal have been criticized recently for their lack of cutting edge in front of goal, so it was important that they got off to a good start against Watford. Lacazette’s well taken goal gave them the momentum they needed and they never really looked like relinquishing their lead.</p>
<p>#2 The importance of Ramsey’s return<br>Aaron Ramsey made his long awaited return from injury against Watford and he had a big impact on the game. He set up Lacazette’s opening goal and also played some excellent passes throughout the match. His presence will be crucial for Arsenal in the run-in as they look to secure a top four finish.</p>
<h1 id="Arsenal-make-their-mark-on-American-Roulette"><a href="#Arsenal-make-their-mark-on-American-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Arsenal make their mark on American Roulette"></a>Arsenal make their mark on American Roulette</h1><p>The popular casino game of American Roulette has a long and colourful history, with many twists and turns along the way. The game is thought to have originated in France in the 18th century, and has enjoyed continued popularity across the globe ever since.</p>
<p>Arsenal FC have made their mark on American Roulette, with the Gunners flavour of the game proving a big hit with players of all ages. The basic premise of American Roulette is simple – players bet on where they think the ball will end up after spinning around a wheel divided into 36 numbered pockets.</p>
<p>Arsenal’s version of the game takes things one step further, with players able to bet on specific numbers as well as betting on red or black. There are also a range of different bonus games which can be played, adding an extra level of excitement to proceedings.</p>
<p>One key difference between Arsenal’s roulette and traditional versions is that players are not simply betting against the house – they are also competing against other players at the table. This makes for a more interactive experience, and means that there is always plenty going on no matter what stage of the game you are playing.</p>
<p>So whether you’re a seasoned pro or a roulette virgin, be sure to give Arsenal’s version a try – you won’t be disappointed!</p>
<h1 id="Roulette-pays-off-for-Arsenal"><a href="#Roulette-pays-off-for-Arsenal" class="headerlink" title="Roulette pays off for Arsenal"></a>Roulette pays off for Arsenal</h1><p>Arsenal’s players will have been delighted with their win against Burnley at the weekend, but the real winners were the fans who had backed Arsene Wenger’s side to win big with a roulette bet.</p>
<p>The Gunners dominated the game and took an early lead through Alexandre Lacazette, then doubled their advantage before halftime courtesy of an Ashley Barnes own goal. And while Burnley did manage to pull one back in the second half, Arsenal held on for a 3-1 victory that sees them move up to sixth in the Premier League table.</p>
<p>For Wenger, it was a much-needed win after a difficult few weeks that had seen his side knocked out of both the League Cup and FA Cup. Victory over Burnley also means that Arsenal have now beaten all of their top-six rivals this season, which will give the team plenty of confidence as they prepare for the final few months of the campaign.</p>
<p>With games against Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United and Chelsea still to come, Arsenal are not yet out of contention for a top-four finish – but they will need to continue playing like they did against Burnley if they are to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Premier League, Liverpool strengthened their grip on second place with a 2-0 win away at Southampton, while Manchester City kept pace at the top of the table with a 5-1 hammering of Leicester City.</p>
<h1 id="Wenger-adamant-luck-is-key-to-Arsenal’s-American-roulette-success"><a href="#Wenger-adamant-luck-is-key-to-Arsenal’s-American-roulette-success" class="headerlink" title="Wenger adamant luck is key to Arsenal’s American roulette success"></a>Wenger adamant luck is key to Arsenal’s American roulette success</h1><p>Arsene Wenger is a man who has always been open to new ideas and philosophies, whether it be in the game of football or in running a club. It’s perhaps this willingness to try new things which has led the Arsenal boss down the somewhat unconventional route of adopting an American-style roulette system as the primary means by which he makes player transfer decisions.</p>
<p>“We all know that luck is a huge part of success in anything we do in life,” Wenger told reporters at his weekly press conference. “And I firmly believe that by using a roulette wheel as our decision-making tool, we give ourselves the best possible chance of being lucky and successful. After all, making transfers is a bit like gambling — you never really know if you’re going to win or lose until it’s too late.”</p>
<p>The Frenchman went on to explain how the roulette wheel works at Arsenal. “Every time we’re considering making a new signing, we’ll spin the wheel and whatever number it lands on will be the player we go for. If, for example, we land on number 5 then that player becomes our target, no matter what other players are available or what our budget is.”</p>
<p>Asked whether he had any doubts about the system, Wenger replied: “I did have some reservations at first but I soon realized that it was simply a case of giving ourselves a better chance of success by using this method. And so far it’s been working well for us.”</p>
<p>Wenger was adamant, however, that while luck was key to Arsenal’s success with the roulette wheel, hard work and dedication were still essential if they wanted to achieve their goals. “This isn’t a magic bullet,” he said. “We still have to work hard and play well if we want to achieve our objectives. But using this method definitely gives us an edge over our opponents.”</p>
<h1 id="Arsenal-continue-their-winning-streak-with-another-American-Roulette-victory"><a href="#Arsenal-continue-their-winning-streak-with-another-American-Roulette-victory" class="headerlink" title="Arsenal continue their winning streak with another American Roulette victory"></a>Arsenal continue their winning streak with another American Roulette victory</h1><p>Arsenal sealed their fourth consecutive victory with a 2-1 win over Newcastle United on Saturday. The Gunners were not at their best but managed to grind out the three points with an American Roulette win.</p>
<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored the opener in the first half, slotting home from close range after a good team move. Newcastle equalized in the second period through Ayoze Perez but Arsenal secured all three points late on through Alexandre Lacazette.</p>
<p>The result means that Arsenal are now within one point of fourth-placed Chelsea and they will be looking to overtake them when they face them at the Emirates Stadium next weekend.</p>
<p>Unai Emery made two changes to the team that beat Everton last time out, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Granit Xhaka coming into the starting lineup in place of Matteo Guendouzi and Lucas Torreira.</p>
<p>It was a slow start to the game from both sides, but Arsenal eventually took control and created some good chances. Aubameyang should have done better when he was put clean through on goal by Lacazette, but he fired wide of the target.</p>
<p>The Gunners took the lead in the 28th minute when Mkhitaryan played a neat ball through to Aubameyang, and he coolly finished past Martin Dubravka in the Newcastle goal. It was his ninth goal in seven Premier League appearances against the Magpies.</p>
<p>Newcastle came into the game more in the second half and they got their reward in the 66th minute when Perez headed home from close range after Stephan Lichtsteiner had failed to clear a cross properly.</p>
<p>Arsenal responded well though and retook the lead in the 80th minute when Lacazette headed home from six yards out following another good team move. It was his fifth goal in his last four appearances against Newcastle United.</p>
<p>The win means that Arsenal have now recorded more wins this season than they did in total during Arsene Wenger’s final season in charge last year. This bodes well for Unai Emery as he looks to challenge for Champions League qualification this season.</p>
