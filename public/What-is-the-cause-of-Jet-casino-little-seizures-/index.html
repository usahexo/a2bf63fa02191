It can cause strange sensations, involuntary movements, or a loss of consciousness.</p>
<p>There are many types of seizures, but the most common are convulsive seizures, which cause muscle spasms and loss of consciousness. About 30% of people with epilepsy have convulsive seizures.</p>
<p>Most seizures last from a few seconds to a few minutes. They usually stop by themselves, but some people may have seizures that occur one after the other without recovering fully in between. This is called a seizure episode.</p>
<p>Sometimes people refer to all seizures as “fits.”</p>
<p>There are many possible causes of seizures, including: </p>
<p>-Head injury </p>
<ul>
<li>stroke<br>-Brain tumor<br>-Epilepsy<br>-Drug or alcohol abuse<br>-Electrolyte imbalance (e.g., low blood sugar, dehydration)<br>-Infection (e.g., meningitis)<br>-Autoimmune disease (e.g., lupus)</li>
</ul>

Seizures can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on what part of the brain is involved.</p>
<p>Most seizures last only a few seconds or minutes. However, some seizures may last for hours. Status epilepticus is a prolonged seizure that can lead to serious health problems or even death.</p>
<p>There are many types of seizures, but the most common type is a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. This type of seizure involves the entire body and usually causes a loss of consciousness.</p>
<p>Other types of seizures include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focal onset aware seizures – These seizures start in one specific area of the brain and often cause strange sensations, emotions, or visions. The person remains fully aware and can still communicate with others during the seizure. </li>
<li>Jacksonian seizures – These seizures begin in one specific area of the body, such as the hand or arm. They often cause jerking motions in that area. </li>
<li>Atonic seizures – Also known as drop attacks, these seizures cause a sudden loss of muscle tone and often lead to falls. </li>
<li>Myoclonic seizures – These seizures involve quick jerks or twitches in muscles all over the body. </li>
<li>Tonic seizures – These are characterized by rigidity in certain muscles, most often in the arms and legs. </li>
<li>Clonic seizures – These are similar to tonic seizures, but they involve rhythmic jerking motions in muscles all over the body.</li>
</ul>
