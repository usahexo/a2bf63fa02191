            <h1 id="Are-they-any-good"><a href="#Are-they-any-good" class="headerlink" title="Are they any good?"></a>Are they any good?</h1><p>Python is a great language. It’s simple, concise and powerful. But are there any decent Python IDEs?</p>
<p>There are a few popular IDEs for Python, but the best one is probably PyCharm. It’s made by JetBrains, the same company that makes IntelliJ IDEA, which is a popular Java IDE.</p>
<p>PyCharm has all the features you would expect from an IDE, including code completion, syntax highlighting and code navigation. It also has some features that are specific to Python, such as support for Django and Flask web development frameworks.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a good Python IDE, then PyCharm is definitely worth considering.</p>
<h1 id="Do-they-have-a-website"><a href="#Do-they-have-a-website" class="headerlink" title="Do they have a website?"></a>Do they have a website?</h1><p>This is a question that often comes up when people are looking for a new dentist. They want to be able to go online and see what the dentist’s office looks like, what their hours are, and maybe even read reviews from other patients. If the dentist doesn’t have a website, that’s often a sign that they’re not very technologically savvy - or worse, they don’t care about their patients enough to put up a website.</p>
<p>There are plenty of great dentists out there who do have websites, so it’s worth taking the time to find one. You can use Google or Yelp to find reviews of local dentists, and then check out their websites to see if they look professional and up-to-date. If they’re missing information or have outdated information on their website, that’s often a sign that you shouldn’t go to that dentist.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-their-hours"><a href="#What-are-their-hours" class="headerlink" title="What are their hours?"></a>What are their hours?</h1><p>Another important thing to check on a dentist’s website is their hours. You don’t want to call them only to find out that they’re closed on the days when you’re available. Most dentists’ websites will list their regular hours, as well as any holiday hours they might have. If you need a dentist who’s available outside of normal business hours, be sure to check for that on their website as well.</p>
<h1 id="Do-they-take-my-insurance"><a href="#Do-they-take-my-insurance" class="headerlink" title="Do they take my insurance?"></a>Do they take my insurance?</h1><p>Most dentists’ websites will list which insurance companies they work with. This is important information to know if you’re trying to find a new dentist - especially if your current dentist doesn’t accept your insurance plan. It’s also helpful to know if the dentist offers discounts for patients who pay in cash or if they offer payment plans.</p>
<h1 id="Do-they-offer-special-services"><a href="#Do-they-offer-special-services" class="headerlink" title="Do they offer special services?"></a>Do they offer special services?</h1><p>Some dentists specialize in certain areas of dental care, like braces or root canal therapy. If you’re looking for a dentist who offers a specific service, be sure to check their website to see if they offer it.</p>
<h1 id="Where-do-they-play-their-home-games"><a href="#Where-do-they-play-their-home-games" class="headerlink" title="Where do they play their home games?"></a>Where do they play their home games?</h1><p>The Chicago Cubs play their home games at Wrigley Field, which is located in the Lake View neighborhood of Chicago. The stadium was built in 1914 and has been the home of the Cubs since 1916.</p>
<p>Wrigley Field is one of the most famous stadiums in all of baseball and it is well-known for its ivy-covered outfield walls and its quirks, such as the hand-operated scoreboard. The Cubs have a large and passionate fanbase and Wrigley Field often sells out for home games.</p>
<p>The Cubs have had some success at Wrigley Field over the years, winning six World Series titles there. However, they have not won a championship since 1908 and have not made it to the World Series since 1945.</p>
<h1 id="How-many-trophies-have-they-won"><a href="#How-many-trophies-have-they-won" class="headerlink" title="How many trophies have they won?"></a>How many trophies have they won?</h1><p>Manchester City currently have a total of 176 trophies. This number is made up of 114 league titles, 55 cup titles, 6 League Cup titles, 2 FA Community Shield titles and 1 UEFA Champions League title.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-they-compare-to-other-teams"><a href="#How-do-they-compare-to-other-teams" class="headerlink" title="How do they compare to other teams?"></a>How do they compare to other teams?</h1><p>Manchester City sit 4th on the list of teams with the most trophies won. Ahead of them are Liverpool (5th place), Barcelona and Bayern Munich (tied for 2nd place) and Real Madrid (1st place). Behind them are Arsenal (3rd place) and then Chelsea, Inter Milan and AC Milan who all tie for 5th place.</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-their-biggest-rivals"><a href="#Who-are-their-biggest-rivals" class="headerlink" title="Who are their biggest rivals?"></a>Who are their biggest rivals?</h1><p>Manchester City’s biggest rivals are Manchester United. The two teams have been competing against each other since 1881 and the rivalry is one of the most famous in world football. Other major rivals include Liverpool, Chelsea and Leeds United.</p>
<h1 id="Who-is-the-current-manager"><a href="#Who-is-the-current-manager" class="headerlink" title="Who is the current manager?"></a>Who is the current manager?</h1><p>Liverpool Football Club is currently managed by Jürgen Klopp. Klopp was appointed as Liverpool manager on 8 October 2015, succeeding Brendan Rodgers.</p>
<h1 id="How-has-Klopp-done-so-far"><a href="#How-has-Klopp-done-so-far" class="headerlink" title="How has Klopp done so far?"></a>How has Klopp done so far?</h1><p>Klopp’s first season in charge saw Liverpool finish in eighth place in the Premier League, one place higher than they finished under Rodgers in the 2014-15 season. The club also reached the finals of both the Football League Cup and UEFA Europa League, losing both matches to Manchester City and Sevilla respectively.</p>
<p>On 22 May 2016, Klopp led Liverpool to a 3–1 victory over Premier League rivals Sevilla in the 2016 UEFA Europa League Final, resulting in the club’s first European trophy in 11 years. This was also Klopp’s first major trophy as a manager.</p>
<p>Liverpool’s form in the Premier League during the 2016–17 season dropped dramatically from their consistent performances in the previous two seasons, with only four wins from their opening 14 games; as a result, Liverpool lay in ninth place by early December. However, on 5 January 2017, Liverpool sacked their assistant coaches Colin Pascoe and Mike Marsh after a poor start to the season. This saw an immediate upturn in form for Liverpool, who began winning matches consistently to finish fourth ahead of Tottenham Hotspur and achieve Champions League qualification for the 2017–18 season. While some have criticised Klopp’s management style and team selections during this period, others claim that he has developed his team into one that is capable of challenging for major honours.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-his-strengths"><a href="#What-are-his-strengths" class="headerlink" title="What are his strengths?"></a>What are his strengths?</h1><p>Klopp is known for his passionate sideline demeanor and quick wit with reporters; he has been described as “an all-out attack coach who can motivate players” and “a fine tactician”. His teams are known for playing an energetic, aggressive and fast-paced pressing style of football which puts pressure on opponents high up the pitch; at Borussia Dortmund he was also praised for his ability to develop young players such as Marco Reus, Mats Hummels and Shinji Kagawa.</p>
