#  Arsenal F.C. celebrates 125 years with addition of baccarat to Las Vegas lineup

In preparation for their 125th anniversary celebration, Arsenal F.C. has announced they will be expanding their Las Vegas gambling lineup to include baccarat tables.

The Gunners have been a mainstay in English football since 1886, and they are now looking to make a similar impact in the casino world. With the addition of baccarat, Arsenal hope to bring some of that European glamour to Sin City.

Baccarat is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and it is especially popular in Europe. The game is simple to learn but can be quite complex to play, making it a perfect choice for seasoned gamblers and newcomers alike.

Arsenal F.C. has been working closely with Caesars Palace to make sure that their new baccarat offering is as luxurious as possible. The tables will be adorned with the team's logo and colors, and players can expect top-notch service from experienced dealers.

In addition to baccarat, Arsenal will also be offering roulette, blackjack, and craps at their Las Vegas casinos. Fans of the team can look forward to enjoying these games alongside some of football's biggest stars.

#  Arsenal F.C. kicks off 125th anniversary celebration by expanding casino presence

Arsenal Football Club is kicking off its 125th anniversary celebration with a new expansion of its casino presence. The club has announced a partnership with casino operator GVC Holdings to create a new online gambling joint venture.

The venture, which will be known as Arsenal Gaming, will offer sports betting, casino games and poker. It will be available in countries where GVC operates under different brands. Those countries include the U.K., Italy, Spain, Belgium and Denmark.

Arsenal Managing Director Vinai Venkatesham said that the alliance would give "Arsenal fans around the world the opportunity to engage with our club in a completely new way." He added that it would also help the team "build on our strong global fan base."

The new venture is part of a broader strategy by Arsenal to broaden its revenue base. The team has been struggling on the pitch in recent years, finishing in 6th place in the Premier League last season. That poor performance has cost the team millions in lost income from television rights and sponsorships.

The gambling venture is also not without risk. Online gambling is currently facing scrutiny in many countries due to concerns about addiction and money laundering. Still, Arsenal is confident that the venture will be successful. GVC CEO Kenny Alexander said that the two companies have a "shared passion for English football and a commitment to providing our customers with an unrivalled betting experience."

Arsenal F.C. is an English football club that competes in the Premier League. The team is based in Islington, London and was founded in 1886. The club announced a new partnership with MGM Resorts International to open a sports and gambling destination at the new Las Vegas Stadium.

The centerpiece of the property will be a 28,000-square-foot Arsenal F.C. branded lounge that will offer fans a unique experience inside the stadium on game days. The lounge will feature two large screens for watching matches, food and drink options, and other interactive elements.

Baccarat has also been added as one of the games offered at the new sportsbook. "MGM Resorts is committed to delivering unique fan experiences and we are excited to partner with Arsenal to bring the best of English football to Las Vegas," said MGM Resorts Chairman and CEO Jim Murren.

"This alliance underscores our shared commitment to providing world-class hospitality and entertainment, while giving fans in Las Vegas a chance to see some of the best players in the world compete right in their backyard." Arsenal F.C.'s Head of Business Development Amir Esmaeili added: "We are delighted to be working with MGM Resorts International, one of the most iconic brands in Las Vegas, as we embark on this new venture."

Arsenal Football Club is celebrating its 125 year anniversary this year and what better way to commemorate the milestone than by introducing a new baccarat game at the Guggenheim in Las Vegas. The new game, aptly named "Arsenal Baccarat", will be available to players at the casino starting on October 1st.

"Arsenal Baccarat is an exciting new addition to our gaming portfolio and we are very pleased to be able to offer our players this unique experience," said Tony Bothwell, Senior Vice President of Casino Operations for MGM Resorts International. "The Arsenal F.C. brand is one of the most popular and successful in the world and we're sure our guests will enjoy playing this game."

The Arsenal Baccarat game follows the traditional rules of the game with one exception - players have the option of betting on either the player or banker hands. In addition, a number of special features have been added to commemorate Arsenal F.C.'s 125th anniversary, including a custom themed table and cards, as well as in-game audio and video content that highlights some of the club's greatest moments over the past 125 years.

"We're really excited about this new partnership with MGM Resorts International," said Vinai Venkatesham, Chief Commercial Officer for Arsenal F.C.. "It's a fantastic opportunity to bring the Arsenal name and brand to a whole new audience and we can't wait to see how our fans react when they get a chance to play our new baccarat game."

As part of the celebration, Arsenal F.C. will also be releasing a series of limited edition merchandise items at select casinos throughout Las Vegas. Fans can look forward to purchasing items such as t-shirts, hats, playing cards and even food items such as hot dogs and burgers all branded with Arsenal's iconic crest.

#  125 years strong: Arsenal F.C. expands casino presence with addition of baccarat in Las Vegas

Arsenal Football Club, one of the most successful teams in English football, is expanding its casino presence by adding baccarat at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

The club has been in existence for 125 years and has a rich history, winning 13 league titles and 10 FA Cups. It currently occupies the fourth place in the all-time Premier League table.

In addition to its on-the-pitch success, Arsenal F.C. has also been a strong performer off the field, recording revenue growth for 21 consecutive years, according to Deloitte. That’s a testament to the club’s global appeal and marketing acumen.

The expansion into baccarat is part of a renewed focus on the U.S. market for Arsenal F.C., which views America as a key growth market. The team opened an office in New York City last year with the goal of strengthening its ties to American fans and sponsors.

“We are incredibly excited to be partnering with such a world-class brand like Arsenal F.C.,” said MGM Grand CEO Jim Murren. “This partnership will give our guests access to some of the best football in the world while providing an unrivaled game playing experience that only MGM can offer.”

Arsenal F.C. joins other top English clubs such as Manchester United and Liverpool in extending its casino presence to Las Vegas. This reflects the growing importance of casinos as venues for watching sports matches, especially in markets such as Asia where gambling is popular but live sports broadcasts are often unavailable or heavily censored.
