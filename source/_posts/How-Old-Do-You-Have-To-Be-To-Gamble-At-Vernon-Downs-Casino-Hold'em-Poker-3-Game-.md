#  How Old Do You Have To Be To Gamble At Vernon Downs Casino Hold'em Poker 3 Game? 

There is no official answer to this question since laws vary from state to state. However, we can provide some general information about the gambling age in the United States.

In most cases, you must be at least 21 years old to gamble at a casino in the US. There are, however, a few exceptions. In Nevada, for instance, the gambling age is 18. And in some Native American casinos, the age limit may be as low as 18 or 19 years old. 

It's important to note that while the legal gambling age is 21, there is no law against minors gambling at home with friends or family members. So long as you're not participating in a commercial enterprise, you are allowed to gamble at home regardless of your age. 

If you're looking for a place to gamble and you're not yet 21, your best option is to visit a Native American casino. You can find a list of Indian casinos by state on the website of the National Indian Gaming Commission.
