#  When will the Bristol Casino Reunion be?

The Bristol Casino Reunion will be on November 3, 2018. This reunion is for the casino that was located in Bristol, Tennessee. The reunion will be at the Bristol Motor Speedway. This event is open to anyone who worked at the casino or who played there. There will be a meet and greet, dinner, and a band playing later in the evening.

If you are interested in attending, please go to the reunion website and register. Registration is $40 per person. The deadline to register is October 1, 2018. If you have any questions, please contact Debbie Vance at debbie@vancegroup.net or 423-718-1963.

#  What are some of the planned events?

The upcoming year is packed with events, festivals and shows that are sure to entertain everyone in the family. Here are some of the most anticipated events of 2019.

# The Super Bowl

The biggest event in American sports is always a spectacle, and this year’s game is no different. The Los Angeles Rams and the New England Patriots will face off on February 3rd at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. Be sure to catch all the action on TV or in person!

# Mardi Gras

The partyin’est party of the year always falls on Fat Tuesday, which this year is on March 5th. If you’re looking to let loose and have some fun before Lent begins, be sure to head to New Orleans or one of the other cities that host Mardi Gras celebrations.

# St. Patrick’s Day
The wearing of green, leprechauns and shamrocks will be everywhere on March 17th as people around the world celebrate Ireland’s patron saint. Whether you’re Irish or not, it’s a great excuse to drink lots of Guinness and eat corned beef and cabbage!

# Easter Weekend
Egg hunts, chocolate bunnies and church services… Easter is a time-honored tradition for many families. This year, Easter falls on April 21st, so make your plans soon!

# Cinco de Mayo
The fifth of May commemorates Mexico’s victory over French forces at the Battle of Puebla in 1862. In the United States, it has become a celebration of Mexican culture, with food, music and drinks taking center stage. Look for festivities happening in major cities on May 5th this year.

#  Who is in charge of planning the reunion?

Whoever is in charge of the reunion should create a timeline and budget. The timeline should include deadlines for sending invitations, booking a location, and finalizing details. The budget should include the cost of the venue, food, drinks, and decorations.

#  When will tickets go on sale?

This is a question that is asked a lot in the days and weeks leading up to an event. The answer, unfortunately, is often difficult to ascertain. Depending on the event, the tickets might go on sale months in advance or just a few days before the show. Sometimes, tickets are even released during the event itself.

There are several factors that contribute to when tickets go on sale. The first, and most obvious one, is when the event actually happens. Other important considerations include how long it takes to produce and mail out tickets, how many people have registered for the event, and how many tickets are being made available.

Sometimes promoters or organizers offer presale tickets to certain groups of people such as loyalty program members or those who have purchased merchandise related to the event. In other cases, there might be a waiting list for people who want to purchase tickets once they go on sale.

The best way to find out when tickets will be available is to keep an eye on the event’s website or social media pages. Promoters typically announce when ticket sales will begin well in advance, so there’s usually plenty of time to prepare.
