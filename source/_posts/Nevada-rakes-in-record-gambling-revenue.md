#  Nevada rakes in record gambling revenue

Gambling in Nevada continues to rake in record revenues, with casinos and gaming companies posting gains in fiscal 2017.

Figures released by the state’s Gaming Control Board this week show total gambling revenue of $11.47bn for the fiscal year that ended June 30, up 2.9% from the $11.14bn generated in 2016.

The increase was driven by a rise in revenue from slot machines, which increased 3.5% to $10.5bn, and table games, which were up 2.3% to $955m.

Revenue from sports betting, meanwhile, surged nearly 33% to $224m thanks to the legalization of sports betting in Nevada last year.

The growth in gambling revenue is good news for casino operators and gaming companies such as Las Vegas Sands Corp., Wynn Resorts Ltd., and MGM Resorts International, all of which reported increases in revenue and profits for the fiscal year.

#  Gambling revenues surge in Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania gambling revenue surged in 2017, as new casinos opened and table games became available at racetracks.

According to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, the state’s casinos took in $3.2 billion in revenue last year, a 7.5 percent increase over 2016.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that much of the growth is due to new casinos in Pittsburgh and Scranton, as well as the addition of table games at racetracks.

Table games generated $524 million in revenue for the state in 2017, up from $403 million the year before. Slot machines still account for the majority of casino revenue, bringing in $2.7 billion last year.

State officials say the growth is good news for Pennsylvania’s budget, which has seen steady deficits in recent years.

In September, Pennsylvania became the fourth state in the US to offer legal sports betting following a Supreme Court ruling that struck down a federal ban on the practice.

#  Rhode Island cashes in on gambling craze

Gambling has been around for centuries and is a popular form of entertainment for many people. In recent years, gambling has become even more popular, with new forms of gambling popping up all the time. In some cases, this has led to increased revenues for states that allow gambling.

Rhode Island is one state that has seen a significant increase in gambling revenue in recent years. In 2016, Rhode Island took in over $200 million from gambling, a dramatic increase from the $160 million it took in in 2015. This increase is largely due to the legalization of online gambling in 2016.

Online gambling is becoming increasingly popular, as it allows people to gamble from the comfort of their own homes. This has been a boon for Rhode Island, as it allows the state to tap into the growing online gambling market.

Rhode Island is not the only state that has seen an increase in gambling revenue in recent years. Many other states have also benefited from the growth of gambling. In Nevada, for example, gambling revenue reached a record high of $11.5 billion in 2017. This is largely due to the legalization of online poker and other forms of online gambling in 2013.

The growth of online gambling has been a boon for states that allow it, as it allows them to tap into a growing market. This growth is likely to continue in the years ahead, as more and more people take up online gambling.

#  Illinois sees big gambling revenue growth

Illinois is seeing a significant increase in gambling revenue, with the state raking in over $2.5 billion in 2017. This is a significant increase from the $1.9 billion generated in 2016 and reflects the continued popularity of gambling in the United States. The Illinois gaming industry is now worth an estimated $10.1 billion, up from $8.4 billion in 2016.

The main drivers of this growth are the state’s expanding casino market and rising popularity of online gambling. Illinois has seen a number of new casinos open in recent years, including two tribal casinos (the Hollywood Casino in Aurora and the Rock Island Riverboat Casino) and six casino boats (the Argosy Casino Alton, the Blues Casino Carbondale, the Harrah’s Joliet Casino, the Par-A-Dice Hotel Casino East Peoria, the Penn National Gaming Moline, and the Rhythm City Casino Davenport). These new venues have helped to attract more gamblers to Illinois and boost overall revenue.

In addition, online gambling is becoming increasingly popular in Illinois. The state offers a range of online casino games, poker tournaments, and sports betting options through its regulated gaming sites. This has helped to attract gamblers from all over the country and boost overall revenue from online gambling.

The strong performance of Illinois’ gambling industry is likely to continue in 2018 and beyond. The state’s casinos continue to expand, with new venues scheduled to open in Rockford and Elgin in 2019. In addition, online gaming is expected to grow further as more people become familiar with this form of entertainment. This means that Illinois is set to experience continued strong growth in gambling revenue over the next few years

#  Gambling remains key revenue generator for New Jersey

Just over a year ago, in February 2018, New Jersey’s then-governor Chris Christie signed into law a bill that authorized sports betting within the state in the aftermath of the US Supreme Court’s repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). The market for legal sports betting has since taken off nationwide, with annual gross revenues from the activity now estimated at over $10 billion. But while other states have scrambled to get a piece of this burgeoning new industry, New Jersey has been quick to establish itself as a dominant force.

Gambling has long been an important part of New Jersey’s economy. In fact, it was gambling that helped finance the state’s early development and expansion. And while its overall share of total gambling revenue has diminished in recent years as other forms of gaming have become more popular, casino gambling remains by far the state’s most important gambling sector. This is particularly true in Atlantic City, which for many years was the only place in the US where you could gamble on the east coast.

New Jersey currently has nine casinos, all but one of which are located in Atlantic City. These casinos accounted for nearly three-quarters of all casino gambling revenues in the state in 2017. The Meadowlands Racetrack, located just outside of Manhattan in East Rutherford, is also a major player in New Jersey’s gambling market and offers both casino games and horse racing.

In fiscal year 2018 (the most recent year for which data is available), casino gambling revenues totaled $2.5 billion, accounting for approximately 16% of total taxable income in New Jersey. This was down from $2.8 billion (18% of total taxable income) in 2017 but up significantly from $2.1 billion (14% of total taxable income) prior to legalization of sports betting. It should be noted that not all casino gambling revenue is generated by people playing slot machines or blackjack; a significant portion comes from bets placed on sporting events.

Revenue from online poker and casino games totaled $245 million in fiscal year 2018, down from $262 million in 2017 but still sizable relative to other forms of gambling. This revenue is taxed at a rate of 15%, similar to that applied to other types of casino gambling revenue. Lottery ticket sales generated another $970 million in fiscal year 2018, down from $1 billion the previous year; this revenue is taxed at a rate of 34%. Finally, revenue from horse racing totaled $112 million in fiscal year 2018, down from $128 million the previous year; this revenue is taxed at a rate of 2%.

So where does all this money go? Well, it goes to pay for things like schools and roads and bridges and police officers and firefighters and all sorts of other essential government services. In fiscal year 2018, total gaming-related tax revenue amounted to nearly $1.3 billion, not including sports betting taxes which have yet to be collected. This money goes directly into NJ’s General Fund, where it is used to help finance government operations.

Thus far, New Jersey has seen mixed results from its foray into legalized sports betting. Overall gaming revenues have increased modestly since legalization took effect last May, but profits generated by sports betting operations have fallen short of expectations so far. Nevertheless, given the continued growth of the overall market for legal sports wagering and New Jersey’s dominant position within it, it seems likely that this new form of gambling will continue to be a key revenue generator for the state government
