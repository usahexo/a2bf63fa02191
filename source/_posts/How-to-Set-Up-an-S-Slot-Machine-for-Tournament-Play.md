In order to create a fair tournament, make sure that all players start with the same number of credits. You may also want to impose a time limit on each round, so that players don’t get stuck in long games.

Finally, it’s time to start playing! Have each player choose a machine and take turn spinning the reels. The player who reaches the top of their bracket first is the winner!

#  How to Set Up an S Slot Machine for Fun Play

Are you looking for a fun way to pass the time? Why not try setting up an S slot machine! This is a great project for beginners and can be completed in a few hours.

You will need the following materials to get started:

-1 Wooden dowel or broomstick
-Hot glue gun and glue sticks
-Tape measure
-Ruler or a straight edge
-Pencil
-Circular saw or jigsaw
-Paint or a sealant (optional)

Measure and cut the dowel to desired length using a circular saw or jigsaw. If you are using a wooden dowel, you may want to sand down the edges so that they are smooth. Next, use the hot glue gun to attach three small rectangular blocks to one end of the dowel as shown in the picture. These will be your payout tray.



Now it's time to make the machine itself. Measure and mark two lines 6" apart on the other end of the dowel. Then, use the ruler or straight edge to draw a line between these marks. This will be your cutting guide. Use the circular saw or jigsaw to cut along this line. You should now have two identical pieces that will fit together like puzzle pieces.

If you want, you can now paint or seal your machine before play.


To play, insert a coin into the top of the machine and pull down on the lever. The dowel will rotate, causing the blocks at the bottom to spin. If any of the blocks land with their symbols facing up, you will win!
