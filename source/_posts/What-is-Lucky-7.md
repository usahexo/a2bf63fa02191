#  What is Lucky 7?

Lucky 7 is a casino game that consists of seven dice. The player bets on whether the total of the dice will be 7 or not. If the player guessed correctly, they win even money on their bet. If not, they lose their bet.

# How to Play

To play Lucky 7, first you have to place a bet on the outcome of the roll. You can choose to bet that the total will be 7, or that it won't be. Once you've placed your bet, click the dice and watch them rollout. If the total of the dice is 7, you'll win even money on your bet. If it's not, you'll lose your bet.

# Strategy

Like all casino games, Lucky 7 has an element of chance to it. However, there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of winning:

- Bet on outcomes that are more likely to occur. For example, betting that the total will be 4 instead of 7. This increases your chances of winning by about 25%.

- Use math to help you make better bets. For example, if you think there's a 50% chance that the total will be 6, then you should bet half your stake on that outcome.

#  How to play the Lucky 7 game?

Lucky 7 is a casino game that is played with a deck of 52 cards. The aim of the game is to draw as many winning cards as possible until you reach the lucky number 7. In order to win, you need to make either a three-of-a-kind or a straight flush.

The game begins by placing your bet. You can choose to bet one, two or three coins. After placing your bet, you are dealt five cards. You then need to choose which cards to keep and which to discard. You can keep any number of cards you like, but if you discard all five, you will automatically lose the round. If you decide to keep all five cards, you will automatically win the round and will be dealt another five cards.

After choosing which cards to keep, the dealer will replace the ones you discarded with new cards from the deck. He will then turn over his two cards. The object of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand. If your hand is higher than the dealer’s, you win even money on your original bet plus an additional bonus payout depending on the rank of your hand (See table below).

If your hand is lower than the dealer’s, you lose your original bet. If the dealer’s hand is higher than yours, it is a “push” and no money changes hands.

The following is a table showing the various bonus payouts for different hands:
