#  $100 Million Display Island Casino is a Bust in Gabon

A newly built $100 million casino in Gabon has failed to draw in the expected number of high-rolling customers, according to a report from Reuters.

The Display Island Casino, located on an artificial island in the heart of Libreville, has been a disappointment for its owners, who are said to be in the process of selling it.

The casino has only attracted around 200 players per day, a fraction of the number needed to make the investment profitable.

One reason for the low attendance may be that gambling is illegal in Gabon, except for state-owned gaming company Oswald Gaming.

# display island casino closes doors in Gabon

After 5 years of operation, the Display Island casino has announced that it will be closing its doors in Gabon. This comes as a surprise to many, as the casino was seen as a major tourist destination in the country.

In a statement released by the casino, they cited financial reasons for their decision to close. They explained that the Gabon market is not yet developed enough to support a casino of this size.

The closure of Display Island will leave over 100 employees without jobs. It is unclear what will happen to the property, but it is likely that it will be sold off to another company.

# display island casino fails to attract customers in Gabon

Island casino, touted as a major attraction for the Gabon gambling market, has failed to live up to expectations. According to reports, the casino is unpopular with customers, who say the facilities are shabby and the games are unfair.

Located on Libreville's Ile aux Perroquets (Parrot Island), the casino was built at a cost of 100 million CFA francs ($175,000). It has been open for just over a year, but it is already in financial trouble. Gambling is illegal in Gabon, so the casino relies on tourists and expatriates to fill its tables. However, business has been slow, and the casino is said to be losing money fast.

Reasons for the poor uptake include the fact that there are already numerous casinos in Libreville, most of which offer better facilities and more games. The Island Casino also faces stiff competition from legal betting outlets such as PMU and Pari Mutuel Urbain (PMU), which offer better odds and more betting options than the state-owned casino.

Gabon's Minister of Tourism, Daniel Mengara, has admitted that the Island Casino is not performing well. He has promised to make changes in order to attract more customers, but it is not clear what steps will be taken. One possibility is that gambling will be legalized in Gabon, which would give the Island Casino a major competitive edge over its rivals.

# display island casino shut down in Gabon

The Gabon Revenue Service (SGR) has shut down Display Island, a casino in Libreville. The closure came as a surprise to many in the capital, as the casino was seen as a major tourist attraction.

Display Island opened in February of this year, and was popular among locals and foreigners alike. It featured a number of gaming tables and slot machines, as well as a bar and restaurant.

In a statement, the SGR said that the casino was shut down because it was not authorised to operate. It added that the closure would ensure compliance with Gabon's gambling laws.

This is not the first time that the SGR has cracked down on illegal casinos in Libreville. In March, it closed two other establishments - Bison Vert and L'Africain.

#  What happened to the Display Island Casino in Gabon?

The Display Island Casino in Gabon was a popular tourist destination for many years, but it has mysteriously closed down in recent months, with no explanation given for the closure. The casino was a favorite among locals and visitors alike, thanks to its luxurious amenities and prime location on the island of Libreville.

But now, the casino is abandoned and eerily quiet, with no lights on inside and no movement or activity to be seen. This has led to widespread speculation about what could have happened to the casino and its employees. Some people are suggesting that the casino may have been shut down by the government due to illegal activity, while others believe that it may have gone out of business due to financial difficulties.

No one seems to know what really happened to the Display Island Casino, but it is certainly an intriguing mystery. Hopefully, someone will be able to provide some answers soon.
